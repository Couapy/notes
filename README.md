## Overview

Notes is a web application that allows you to take notes quickly.

The main goal of this project is to replace Google Keep and Microsoft OneNote, and create an unique web application that deal with all features of theses two softwares.

To have a look on the final project, it should look like to [takenote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote).

## Different types of notes

So the application provides the following note types :

* list (with checkboxes)
  * checked boxes must be above the others list elements
* text (markdown, links, images, etc...)
  * a preview is available

## Organise your notes

Obviously, if you take a lot of notes you space will be quickly busy.
That is why we decided to create an organization system as follow.

### Notebooks

By default notes are the user global space : free notes.

But if you want to organise your notes, the system allows you to create and manage different space called "notebooks".
Inside a notebook you could create sections / sub-sections / sub-sub-sections / etc...
Inside theses sections you can create, move and organise notes.

### Archives and trash

Then, if you just don't need anymore a note, you can delete notes.

But if your goal keeps alive a note/notebook, right click on it and "Archive".

So there are two last spaces :

* Trash
* Archives

## Second version
https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote
This is a list of propositions of features for the second version of the application :

* progressive web app
* offline version
* extends textual notes with drawing =)
